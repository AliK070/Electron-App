# Using Flat Notes:

To use flat notes you simply click on the "add note" button to add a sticky note to the page, and from there you can either clear all notes off of the page if you need to make more room or you can simply delete one of them by clicking on the trash icon. You can change the navbar alingment to your note taking style!
